# final-proj

Hi y'all, this package was designed for a user to input a FASTA sequence and return the top 10 closest BLASTn matches and an MSA alignment.

Things you have to download:
<code> pip install pdf2image </code>
https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/

This module only works on Python 3.5+ and converts a PDF to a PIL Image object
